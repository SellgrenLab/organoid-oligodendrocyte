# Oligodendrocyte precursor cells engulf synapses in a model of the developing human forebrain

## Abstract
Recent work in animal models suggests the role of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) is not limited to oligodendrogenesis. Here, we report that OPCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells are capable of engulfing synaptosomes. We then develop a novel multi-lineage forebrain organoid in which OPCs alongside microglia display a spontaneous internalization of synaptic material in their phagolysosomes. Collectively, these findings suggest that OPCs contribute to synapse elimination in the developing human forebrain and provide a versatile platform for evaluating the interplay between microglia and OPCs in remodeling neuronal circuits in health and disease.
